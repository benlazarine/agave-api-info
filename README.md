# Information about Agave API

[Agave](https://agaveapi.co) first began in February 2011 as a pilot project for The iPlant Collaborative (now CyVerse). One of the main goals was to enable bioinformaticians to run applications within super computing environments via a simple, REST interface. That first prototype worked well enough to receive additional funding and grow into a viable product (and, now, platform).

The Agave Platform (http://agaveapi.co) is an open source, science-as-a-service API platform for powering your digital lab. Agave allows you to bring together your public, private, and shared high performance computing (HPC), high throughput computing (HTC), Cloud, and Big Data resources under a single, web-friendly REST API.

## [Science APIs](http://www.cyverse.org/science-apis)

One example of leveraging the power of the Agave Platform is found in CyVerse's [Discovery Environment](https://github.com/cyverse/de-info). The Discovery Environment (DE) can run code, manage data, and make use of comput resources (either high performance computing or high throughput computing) from a rich internet application.
